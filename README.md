# ddc-scripts

Some scripts for basic monitor control over DDC

- `dim.sh` â€“ set brightness of all displays at once

- `swim.sh` â€“ switch monitor input source

  Note: there can be some flickering just after switching (intensity varies, sometimes itâ€™s pretty bad) but this seems to go away pretty quickly. Jury is still out on whether this is bad for the monitor(s), so use at your own risk.



### Setup

1. Install [ddcutil](https://github.com/rockowitz/ddcutil/), [i2c-tools](https://i2c.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/I2C_Tools), [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
   On Manjaro/Arch, all of these are available via `pacman` or the AUR
   
2. Double check which VCP codes your monitor(s) actually support with `ddcutil capabilities`. The following codes are required (along with their default values as set in `common.sh`)

    * Brightness ðŸ¡’ VCP 10

    * Input source ðŸ¡’ VCP 60

3. Run any of the scripts listed above. A configuration file will be generated at `~/.config/ddc-scripts`.

    ```json
    {
      "about": "configuration file for https:/github.com/ybnd/ddc-scripts",
      "vcp": {
        "brightness": 10,			// you can adjust these if necessary
        "input_source": 60
      },
      "aliases": {					// you can define value aliases here
      },
      "displays": {					// auto-detected connected displays
        "6": {						// numbers correspond to i2c buses, i.e. /dev/i2c-6
          "name": "Display 6",
        },
        "9": {
          "name": "Display 9",
        }
      }
    }
    ```

#### Value aliases

Add aliases to make specific values easier to remember. For instance, you can assign easy-to-remember names for input sources based on what you connect to them:

```sh
$ ddcutil capabilities
Model: ...
MCCS version: ...
Commands:
   ...
VCP Features:
   ...
   Feature: 60 (Input Source)
      Values:
         0f: DisplayPort-1		# Let's say this is a computer
         10: DisplayPort-2
         11: HDMI-1				# ...and this is a TV
         12: HDMI-2
   ...
```

 In `~/.config/ddc-scripts`, configure the following aliases

```json
  "aliases": {
    "computer": "0f",
    "tv": "11"
  },
```

Now you can use these with `swim.sh`

```sh
$ swim tv
Display 1: 0f ðŸ¡’ 11
$ swim computer
Display 1: 11 ðŸ¡’ 0f
```
